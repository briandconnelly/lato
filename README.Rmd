**This package is in early development. It probably will not work well for you.**

It will also be re-named.


## Example

```{r mtcars_example, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(lato)

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = as.factor(cyl) )) +
    facet_grid(cyl ~ .) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    scale_color_hue(name = "# Cylinders") +
    labs(
        x = "Weight (tons)",
        y = "Fuel Efficiency (mpg)",
        title = "Just Buy a Convertible",
        subtitle = "Lighter cars are more efficient. Shave off some weight by\nditching the roof, and drive your savings to the bank!",
        caption = "Source: Motor Trend"
    ) +
    theme_lato()

p1
```

### Dark Mode

```{r mtcars_dark, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p1 + theme_lato_dark()
