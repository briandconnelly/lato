**This package is in early development. It probably will not work well for you.**

It will also be re-named.


## Installation

This package is not ready for [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) just yet, but you can use [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) to be wild and install install the latest and greatest development version. To do so:                           

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}                                                            
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("briandconnelly/lato") 
```


## Example

```{r mtcars_example, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(lato)

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = as.factor(cyl) )) +
    facet_grid(cyl ~ .) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    scale_color_hue(name = "# Cylinders") +
    labs(
        x = "Weight (tons)",
        y = "Fuel Efficiency (mpg)",
        title = "Just Buy a Convertible",
        subtitle = "Lighter cars are more efficient. Shave off some weight by\nditching the roof, and drive your savings to the bank!",
        caption = "Source: Motor Trend"
    ) +
    theme_lato()

p1
```
